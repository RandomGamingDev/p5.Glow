There's an example for how to use the library in https://github.com/RandomGamingDev/p5.Glow/tree/main/example with its result visible [here](https://randomgamingdev.github.io/p5.Glow/example/)

To use it you can simply include https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/RandomGamingDev/p5.Glow/glow.js in your HTML file! If you want to you can also just download the file and include it in your HTML file that way.

btw stuff updates so remember to specify a version/commit for your library if you want to use a link and don't want your code to automatically update to the newest version of the library
